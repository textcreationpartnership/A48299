            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE City of <hi>London</hi> being the Metropolis of this Kingdom, hath had many large Priviledges and Immunities granted to it by the Favour and Munificence of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to this Day, which hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the erecting and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral Courts therein, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to diſpence the benefit of the ſaid Grants to the Citizens and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb facs="tcp:96072:3"/> of that City. And indeed, whoſoever ſhall conſider the ſaid Priviledges, and the nature and Juriſdiction of the ſaid ſeveral Courts, may conclude there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left for the Citizens to deſire, for the happy and good Government of that City, for the Advancement of the Trade thereof, and for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing every man's Property there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which is not already granted to them, and which by the benefit of the ſaid Courts, they may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy: Some of which Priviledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to all the Inhabitants; as the Recovery of their juſt Debts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands without travelling for the ſame out of the Liberties of the City, which may be done either in the Lord Major's Court or the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs Courts. The Enrolling of Deeds, Settling Eſtates, and Docking En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails by Recoveries of Houſes and
<pb facs="tcp:96072:3"/> Lands in the ſaid Liberties, which are to be done in the Court of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings. Other belong only to the Freemen of the ſaid City; as the Preſervation of the Eſtates of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans by the Court of Aldermen; the regulating all Matters of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Maſters and their Apprentices by the Chamberlain; the eaſie recovering of ſmall Debts under forty ſhillings by the Court of Conſcience; the choice of Officers and ordering of Pariſh Affairs by the Courts of Wardmotes, and the making of By-laws for rectifying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abuſes, and for the well Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City by the Court of Common Councel, and by the Lord Major and Court of Aldermen. And that nothing may be wanting which may any way conduce or tend to the welfare and convenience of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Government of that famous,
<pb facs="tcp:96072:4"/> pleaſant, and profitable River of <hi>Thames</hi> upon one ſide whereof it is ſituated, is granted to the ſaid City, and managed by the Lord Major at his Courts of Conſervacy for the ſaid River.</p>
            <p>As the benefit of theſe ſeveral Courts are very great, ſo the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the practice and uſage of them muſt needs be very deſirable to the Citizens and Inhabitants, there being very few, but at ſome time or other, muſt neceſſarily be cencerned in ſome, if not moſt of them.</p>
            <p>There hath been ſeveral times printed a Tract, called <hi>The City Law,</hi> which treats of ſome of theſe Courts: But there being many O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions and Defects therein, this Diſcourſe hath not only ſupplyed the ſame, but alſo rectified the miſtakes therein; ſhewing at large the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Authorities, Cuſtoms, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
<pb facs="tcp:96072:4"/> of all the above-mentioned Courts, as well to the Delight and Pleaſure, as to the Profit and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Reader.</p>
            <p>In this Treatiſe are inſerted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Acts of Common Councel, all of them ſo neceſſary, or at leaſt expedient to be known, that this Diſcourſe would hardly be compleat without them.</p>
            <p>This whole Work being Compoſed and Digeſted for the Publick good and benefit, it is hoped it may meet with a favourable and candid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and that the Reader will pardon the Faults and Errata's of the Printer.</p>

                  <head>The Oath to be taken by the Appraiſors.</head>
                  <p>YOU and either of you ſhall ſwear that the Appraiſement you have made of the Goods and Chattels in this Schedule or Inventory ſpecified, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto you have ſubſcribed your Names, is a juſt and true Valuation and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſement of the ſame Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96072:25"/> according to the beſt of your Iudgments and Skills. So help you God.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Court-day that the Appraiſors are ſworn, the Plaintiff may have Judgment and Execution for the Goods, bringing two ſufficient Sureties, who will enter into a Recognizance to this effect; <hi>viz.

                  </p>
                  <p>The manner for a Defendant in an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to diſprove or avoid any Debt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, is as followeth.

                  <p>

                     <hi>(naming the day the Action was entered)</hi> I did not owe

                  <p>And if the Defendant be a Freeman of <hi>London,</hi> he muſt have ſix Compurgators, who will ſwear that they believe in their Conſciences that what the Defendant ſwears is true: But if the Defendant be not a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>London,</hi> then two Compurgators will be ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>If the Defendant ſhall not think fit to wage his Law, but will put the Plaintiff to prove his Debt, he muſt in ſuch caſe plead that he owes nothing to the Plaintiff; an iſſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Plea. And in caſe the Plaintiff fail to prove his Debt, a Verdict and Judgment will paſs againſt him for reſtitution of the Money, or value of the Goods attached and condemned. And if the Plaintiff in the Attachment ſhall in ſuch caſe be taken in Execution, and ſhall be unable or unwilling to reſtore the Money, his Security or Pledges that he gave when the Money was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, will be compelled to pay the Money; for the Sureties cannot diſcharge themſelves by rendring the Plaintiff body to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>But if the Plaintiff prove his Debt, the Verdict will paſs for the Plaintiff in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, and then Judgment will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96072:26"/> for the Debt proved to be due; and if ſo much was not recovered upon the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment or Sequeſtration, the Bail for the Defendant are liable to anſwer, and pay the ſame with coſts.</p>

                  <head>Touching Apprentices.</head>
                  <p>BY the cuſtom of <hi>London,</hi> Apprentices that are or ſhall be bound by Indenture above the Age of Fourteen years to Freemen of <hi>London,</hi> for the full term of Seven years, are compellable to ſerve the full term, and an Action will lie againſt the Apprentice for breach of any of the Covenants. But if the Apprentice ſhall be under the Age of Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years at the time of his binding, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture is not good.</p>
                  <p>By the ancient and laudable Cuſtom of the City of <hi>London,</hi> every Maſter ought to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll his Apprentice within the firſt year of his term, before the Chamberlain of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for the time being, who attends every day at his Office in <hi>Guildhall</hi> for that purpoſe. And if the Apprentice be Inrolled within the firſt year of his term, the Fee is but 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> But if he ſhall not be Inrolled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the firſt year, then ſuch Apprentice may be diſcharged from his Maſters Service in ſuch manner as is hereafter ſet forth.</p>
                  <p>In caſe any Apprentice ſhall refuſe to be Inrolled within the firſt year of his term, the Maſter may within that time bring his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96072:26"/> Indenture to the Chamberlain or his Clerk, who will Record the ſame; which Record is as good as an Inrollment, and ſhall barr the Apprentice from diſcharging himſelf. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Citizens of <hi>London</hi> are of opinion not to Inroll any Apprentice, and the reaſon they uſually give is, that if the Apprentice be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled, they are bound to keep him, although he ſhall be a Thief or Gameſter, but if he is not Inrolled they can turn him away at their pleaſure; which is a great miſtake: For if an Apprentice ſhall not be Inrolled, and the Maſter turn him away, the Apprentice may in ſuch caſe bring his Action upon the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in his Indenture, and recover Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from time to time againſt the Maſter: And if the Apprentice be Inrolled and turn'd away, he muſt take the ſame courſe againſt his Maſter. If the Apprentice be a Thief, the Maſter may as lawfully turn him away when he is Inrolled, as when he is not Inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; for the Inrollment is no obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Maſter to keep the Apprentice more than before he was not Inrolled. But by the Inrollment the Maſter anſwers the Oath he took when he was made Free, and obliges the Apprentice not to go away at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And every Maſter ought in Conſcience to Inroll his Apprentice: For otherwiſe he diſappoints the Father, who poſſibly paid the Maſter a conſiderable Sum with his Son Apprentice, and if the Apprentice knows he may leave his Maſters ſervice at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it happens very often that he neglects
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96072:27"/> his Maſters ſervice, and takes bad courſes, whereby the Father loſes both his Money and his Son, which might in all probability have been prevented if the Apprentice had been Inrolled.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Although an Apprentice be Inrolled, he may be diſcharged from his Maſter in caſe the Maſter ſhall beat him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably without juſt cauſe, or in caſe the Maſter refuſe to find him ſufficient neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or if the Maſter turn the Apprentice out of his ſervice, or leave off his Trade, or ſhall neglect to inſtruct his Apprentice, or turn him away; whereas many Citizens do believe that if an Apprentice be Inrolled, he cannot be diſcharged from his Maſter for any cauſe whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>The manner of ſuing out an Apprentices Indenture is thus; He muſt bring his Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or a Copy, to an Attorney in this Court, who will give a Note or Warrant to to one of the Sergeants before mentioned, to ſignifie to the Maſter the Apprentices in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of thing out his Indenture, and for what cauſe; And four Court days after will leaven Summons in writing at the Maſters houſe, for him to appear in this Court, and ſhew cauſe why his Apprentice ſhould not be diſcharged. And if the Apprentice ſue his Indenture out for not Inrollment the Maſter may appear, and delay it a ſmall time, but cannot preſent the Apprentices diſcharge: But if it be for any other cauſe, the Maſter may appear by an Attorney of this Court,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96072:27"/> and plead and try the truth of the matter complained of by the Apprentice, and the Maſter need not doubt a fair Trial; the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries being all Maſters, and the Court con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſhew them all juſt and lawful favour. And if a Verdict paſs for the Apprentice, or the Maſter, no Coſts will be allowed to either party.</p>
                  <p>Many Citizens have been unwilling to have any Cauſe tried in this Court, or the Sheriffs Court, by reaſon of inſufficient Jury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are ſummoned to try Cauſes in both Courts. It is very true, there have been in ſome years men of mean quality and capacity returned for Jurymen to ſerve in this Court; but the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> are the occaſion thereof: For it is the Cuſtom of <hi>London,</hi> that the reſpective Juries to try Cauſes in this Court and the Sheriffs, ſhall be returned by the ſeveral Wards in the City of <hi>London</hi> at their Wardmote Inqueſts eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Christmas,</hi> which they conſtantly do, by an Indenture under their Hands and Seals: In which Indenture they alſo return the Names of the Common-councel-men, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables, and Scavengers. There are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Wards appointed to ſerve as Jurymen for every Month, which are divided as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:

                  <p>If an Action ſhall be depending in this Court, and the party Defendant cannot be relieved but in Equity, in ſuch caſe he may exhibit his Bill againſt the Plaintiff in the Action, and the entring the Bill in Court is a good Injunction to ſtay the Plaintiffs proceedings at Law, without any motion, until the Plaintiff ſhall give in his Anſwer thereto.</p>

                  <p>The manner of removing a Bill out of this Court is thus: Firſt, the Defendant muſt file a Bill in the high Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> againſt the Plaintiff in this Court, and then muſt at the Regiſters Office give Bond to prove the ſuggeſtions in his Bill within four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days, and procure Certificate that his Bill is filed, and ſecurity given as aforeſaid, and then Petition the Lord Chancellor for a <hi>Certiorary</hi> to remove the Bill out of this Court: And when the Petition is anſwered by his Lordſhip, the Clerk in <hi>Chancery</hi> will make the <hi>Certiorary,</hi> which muſt be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Town-clerk, and he will allow it, for which his Fee is 2 <hi>s.</hi> and then the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96072:31"/> for the Defendant in this Court will certifie the Bill, Anſwer, and Proceeding into the high Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> for which his Fee is 10 <hi>d. per</hi> Sheet.</p>
                  <p>If exceptions ſhall be put in to an Anſwer in this Court (and a Cauſe at Law depending between the Parties) the Plaintiff in Equity muſt the next Court move for a day to argue thoſe exceptions, otherwiſe they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled in courſe.</p>
                  <p>If the Defendant in Equity demurr or plead to the Plaintiffs Bill, he muſt the next Court after the Demurrer or Plea is entred, move for an Order to argue ſuch Demurrer or Plea, otherwiſe the ſame will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled in courſe, and the Defendant will be compelled to give an Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>When a Freeman's Apprentice is legally diſcharged from his Maſter, his proper way to recover part of the Money which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter received with him Apprentice, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit a Bill in this Court againſt his Maſter; but if the Apprentice hath ſerved five years, or near that time, this Court will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, in ordering any money to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, unleſs there be very extraordinary cauſe.</p>
                  <p>A Freeman's Widow by a Bill in this Court, may recover her cuſtomary part of her Husband's Eſtate, againſt the Executor of her Husband; but if the Executor live out of the Liberties of <hi>London,</hi> ſhe will be compelled to exhibit her Bill in the high Court of <hi>Chancery.</hi>

                  <p>If any perſon exhibit a Bill in this Court, whoſe Habitation ſhall be out of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>London,</hi> this Court upon a motion will order the Plaintiff to give ſecurity by Bond to pay the Defendants Coſts, in caſe the Bill ſhall happen to be diſmiſt, or in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault thereof will diſmiſs the Bill; and until ſuch Security be given, the Court will not compell the Defendant to give any anſwer to the Bill.</p>

                  <p>If an unfreeman, or any other perſon, ſhall by his Will give a Legacy to an Orphant, the Court of Aldermen may compel the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor of ſuch unfreeman to pay the Money bequeathed into the Chamber of <hi>London,</hi> or give Bond to pay the ſame according to the purport of the Will.</p>
                  <p>If a Freeman dye without a Will, and leave a Wife and Children, Adminiſtration of his Eſtate will be granted to his Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,

                  <p>If a Freeman ſhall give part of his Eſtate to any of his Children in life time in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age or otherwiſe, and afterwards die and make a Will, and give away his Eſtate to his other Children, and ſhall declare that the Child he ſo diſpoſed in marriage, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived 500 <hi>l.</hi> or more of his Eſtate, and was thereby fully advanced; ſuch declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall not bar the perſon ſo married, but he or ſhe may recover an equal ſhare with the other Children of the perſonal Eſtate that belonged to ſuch Freeman at the time of his death; but then ſuch perſon muſt bring in the Money received of his Father in his life time, and reckon it part of the Eſtate left by ſuch Freeman at his death; and ſuch bringing in the Money is called bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into <hi>Hotchpott.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a Freeman ſhall ſettle or make over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of his Eſtate to the uſe of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, with deſign to defraud his Wife of her full third part, the Widow may, after his death, ſet aſide ſuch Settlement by a Bill in this Court.</p>

               <p>After a Verdict obtained in either of theſe Courts, and before Judgment entered, the Defendant may ſtop Judgment by marking the Cauſe before the Lord Major for time to pay the Money recovered; which he may do by ſpeaking to an Attorney in the Majors Court, and giving him 4 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d.</hi> for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>My Lord Major ſits only upon <hi>Saturday</hi> to hear mark't Cauſes; and if upon hearing both Parties, it ſhall appear to his Lordſhip that the Plaintiff obtained a Verdict for more then his juſt Debt, his Lordſhip may remit the Cauſe to Judgment for the juſt Debt only, and give ſuch time to pay the ſame as he ſhall think reaſonable: But his Lordſhip always orders the Defendant to give good Security to pay the Recovery at ſuch times as his Lordſhip directs, and to pay the Coſts in fourteen days.</p>

               <p>If any Maſter ſhall refuſe to make his Apprentice free when the term in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture is expired; upon complaint there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made Mr. Chamberlain will cauſe ſuch Maſter to be ſummoned before him, and if he cannot ſhew good cauſe to the Contrary, will make the Apprentice Free.</p>

               <p>If an Apprentice ſhall be unruly or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly in his Maſters Houſe, or commit any notorious Fault, upon complaint made thereof, Mr. Chamberlain will ſend one of his Officers for ſuch Apprentice, and ſend him to <hi>Bridewell,</hi> or otherwiſe puniſh him, according to the nature of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>If any Maſter ſhall miſuſe his Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice by beating him unreaſonably, or with unlawful weapons, or by neglecting to inſtruct him, or to find him neceſſaries, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on complaint thereof made, Mr. Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain will ſend a Summons for the Maſter to appear before him; and upon hearing both Parties, will relieve the Apprentice, or leave him to take his remedy againſt ſuch Maſter in the Lord Majors Court.</p>
               <p>If any Freeman ſhall refuſe to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Chamberlain, being duly ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, my Lord Major, or Mr. Recorder, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on complaint thereof made, will grant a Warrant to apprehend ſuch Perſon, and compel him to appear; for which Warrant the Fee is 1 <hi>s.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When an Apprentice is by conſent of his Maſter to be turned over to another Maſter of the ſame Trade, it cannot be done by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Scrivener. But the Apprentice ought firſt to be turned over before the Company where he was bound, and then to be turned over before the Chamberlain: And it is to be obſerved, that if an Apprentice be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned over by the Company only, it is no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:96072:133"/> upon the ſecond Maſter to keep ſuch Apprentice, nor is the Apprentice compellable thereby to ſerve ſuch ſecond Maſter, but may depart from the Service of ſuch ſecond Maſter at his pleaſure, by fuing out his Indentures againſt his firſt Maſter, which may be done without the privity or knowledge of the ſecond Maſter; and therefore it is abſolutely neceſſary that all Apprentices ſhould be turned over before the Chamberlain, for thereby the firſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is diſcharged from him, and the ſecond Maſter obliged to keep him, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice will be obliged to ſerve the ſecond Maſter the full term of the Indentures: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſame were made for nine years or more.</p>
               <p>It is the intereſt and advantage of every Maſter and Apprentice, when any difference happens between them, to refer the matter to the Chamberlain, who will freely hear both Parties, and decide the Controverſie for three ſhillings Charge; <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>s.</hi> to the Officer for the Summons, and 2 <hi>s.</hi> to the Clerk for the Order: Whereas if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed at Law for relief, it may probably coſt both Parties 6 <hi>l.</hi> if not more, in Charges; and the Concluſion may be leſs ſatisfactory then if decided by ſuch reference as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
